This example shows the use of threaded MPI to implement a 2D FFT for an
Epiphany coprocessor.

The example was tested on the pre-2015 Parallella image.

In order to build and test this example, at present you need to download and
install a preview release of the libcoprthr_mpi library that has been made
to work with the COPRTHR SDK version 1.6.1.  The preview library is presently
free to download and use for experimentation (non-commercial use).  

The COPRTHR MPI library is not, and will not be, a part of the currently 
available COPRTHR-1 SDK.  Instead it will be available in the future as part of
the new COPRTHR-2 software package being developed by BDT.
